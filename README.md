## How to run code
Recommend to use conda. Then create an environment like:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
If using pip, install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the cells in the .ipynb files under the experiments folder or run them with `python 'python_file_here.py'`

# Central problem, domain, data characteristics
Sentiment analysis, Binary classification (negative / positive)

# Central method: chosen architecture and training mechanisms, with a brief justification if non-standard


# Key experiments & results: present and explain results, e.g. in simple accuracy tables over error graphs up to visualisations of representations and/or edge cases – keep it crisp


# Discussion: summarise the most important results and lessons learned (what is good, what can be improved)
